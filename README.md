# RIVER DAO VOTING DAPP /w ERC20 implementation.

This smart contract is a small project creating a voting dapp that will be used
by a DAO where regitered voters need to have a balance equal or more than 100 VTK to register to
vote and also to be able to register a proposal.

ADMIN has the ability to select Status of the contrat and will be directing most of the function in here.

This is a long smart contract so there will be some anotation arround functions and variable so people
dont get confused when reading the documentation.
